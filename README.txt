Welcome to my GravitySimulator!

The 3 body problem in astrophysics is an infamous problem when it comes to an exact solution. Modelling this problem however, along with many more bodies at once, is much more achievable. 

This project will simulate gravity for an arbitrary number of objects in 3 dimensions,
  using Newton's formula for gravity, F = GMm/r^2.
  
  Setting up:
  - Modify the stars array as desired. For systems that stay centered on the origin (width/2, height/2),
    ensure that the total momentum (mv) = 0 in all directions
    
  Controls:
  - UP, DOWN: control the azimuthal angle of the camera
  - LEFT, RIGHT: control the polar angle (right ascension) of the camera
  - +,-: zoom in and out
